Week 1 (ending Nov 9)

Tasks completed:
- Selected project: “Finding and solving hard-to-generate examples – Speed Bump.”
- Created GitHub repository and pushed initial files.
- Installed and configured Python 3.10 environment with torch, diffusers, accelerate, etc.
- Verified accelerate detection and low-memory model loading.
- Downloaded and tested Stable Diffusion v1.5 model.
- Generated baseline image for the prompt “a speed bump on a suburban road.”
- Observed inaccurate or inconsistent shapes—baseline established.

Next week’s plan:
- Collect small dataset of real speed-bump images.
- Preprocess dataset (resize, filter, add captions).
- Begin fine-tuning setup (LoRA/Textual Inversion).
